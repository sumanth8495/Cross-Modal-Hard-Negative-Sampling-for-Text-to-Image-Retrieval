# Cross-Modal-Hard-Negative-Sampling-for-Text-to-Image-Retrieval
Our project focuses on adapting DPR-style bi-encoders to the text→image domain and integrating QuRe’s score-drop heuristic for hard negative mining. We benchmark against DPR-inspired strategies (ANCE, ICT) and evaluate the effectiveness of these adaptations in cross-modal retrieval task
